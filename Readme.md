# Musical Funicular

The dumbest name ever. This project means to build an open source application engine based on the wonderful [Wren Language](https://wren.io/).


## Planned Features

- [X] Platform wrapper (window and input)
- [ ] Sprite batch renderer
- [ ] Audio system


## How to build

Simply clone the repository recursively. All the needed libraries are included as submodules. You will then need a C++17 compatible compiler and at least CMake 3.16 according to the CMakeLists.txt, but virtually any version could generate build files.

Since this project uses GLFW, if you are building it on Linux you will need to install a few more libraries on your system. If you are unsure, check [this page](https://glfw.org/docs/latest/build_guide.html).


## Contributions

All contributions are very welcome! Be it a bugfix or a new feature that you implemented, feel free to open a pull request. Also, if you are making a game or anything, do let me know. I would love to know how you are using the framework.
